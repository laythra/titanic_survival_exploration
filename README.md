# Titanic Survival Exploration Project
In this mini project, i was able to predict the survival of each passenger aboard the RMS Titanic by manually implementing a simple decision tree to do the job.
The dataset used for this project is the RMS Titanic passenger data.

I also used some visualization techinques to get a better grasp of how our data actually looks like:

At the end of the project i was able to get an accuracy of 80.81% using this extremely simple algorithm which i have built. This was my first machine learning project and it gave me neat brief introduction of the kind of the problems i will be solving using various machine learning models and approaches.It has also given me some kind of a small introduction to the techniques that could help with solving various problems, such as visualization and statistical techniques.

Please head to the "titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb" python notebook to see the implementation along with the description of each step.
