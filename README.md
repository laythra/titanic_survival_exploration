In this mini project, i was able to predict the survival of each passenger aboard the RMS Titanic by manually implementing a simple decision tree to do the job.
The dataset used for this project is the RMS Titanic passenger data.
Please head to the "titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb" python notebook to see the implementation along with the description of each step.
